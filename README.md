# amazona

A simple ecommerce website roughly based on Amazon. Still work in progress. 

Why don't I do everything in NextJS? I can, but I want to make it modular or keep the frontend and backend seperated for flexibility of deployment. Besides, I like how ExpressJS handles middlewares.

Breakdown of technologies to be used:

Language = TypeScript

FrontEnd
- NextJS
- MUI5

BackEnd
- ExpressJS
- MySQL
- Prisma
- Cloudinary (image storage)
- PlanetScale (database storage)
